The skies are clear on the North Sea.
Canâ€™t get past the squareheads blockade.
The commanding officer is coming for an inspection, better look posh.
Keep checking the radar for the German U-Boats
Brace yourselves the German Zeppelin was a couple of kilometers away.
Retreat and save your losses. My fleet is near.
